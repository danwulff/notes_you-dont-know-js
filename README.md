# My notes for: You Don't Know JS

## You Don't Know JS background
You Don't know JS (https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) has been a well regarded source of knowledge for the javascript language. Javascript of course is a fast changing language, ever evolving. However the core of the javascript language has not changed as quickly. Therefore I feel the need to catch up on some of the core principles of JS.

## This Repo / What am I doing?
What am I doing? I have no clue. Welcome to the life of a young web developer. BUT I'm excited to share some of my experiences with you.

This is an experiment in leaving my personal notes (about *You Don't Know JS*) open for the world to see. There's been a lot of talk in the industry about diversity and making sure those with a different perspective/different voices are heard. While I look like an average nerdy white guy, I come from a family of construction workers primarily (I was the second male in my entire extended family to graduate with a bachelor degree, my brother being the first) and also I graduated with an Electrical Engineering degree and spent close to two years making that my career path. So I'm guessing I'm a little bit different than you and your journey, and I believe that's a good thing.

## If you ready any of this!
Let me know your thoughts. I'm interested to hear if people love it, hate it, want more in depth notes etc... You can reach me on twitter [@wulffmandan](https://twitter.com/wulffmandan) or by email danielwulff.ee@gmail.com
